\begin{abstract}
Securing data transmission in IoT-based systems is critical due to the vulnerabilities of resource-constrained devices and the sensitivity of data. This paper introduces a lightweight modified Rivest Cipher 4 (RC4) encryption-based framework to achieve end-to-end security for data transmissions across IoT applications. The sensor data is encrypted using a modified RC4 and transmitted through the MQTT protocol to a Raspberry Pi broker. The broker performs decryption and re-encryption before forwarding the data to Google Cloud Firestore for secure storage and real-time visualization in Looker Studio. System performance was evaluated based on encryption and decryption speed, memory usage, power consumption, and data integrity. Results demonstrate that the modified RC4 offers efficient, low-latency, and energy-conscious encryption suitable for constrained environments, ensuring robust data confidentiality and integrity. This framework facilitates data-driven decisions, confirming modified RC4â€™s applicability to IoT applications despite known vulnerabilities of standard RC4, which are mitigated through strategies like frequent key rotation.

\section{Introduction}
The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) in various domains is revolutionizing traditional practices by introducing data-driven solutions to optimize productivity. One such IoT application is Smart Irrigation Systems, a key application of precision agriculture, based on IoT sensors to monitor environmental parameters such as soil moisture, temperature and humidity, allowing informed irrigation decisions and efficient resource utilization \cite{ref7}.

However, the proliferation of IoT devices in agricultural environments raises significant security concerns. These devices often operate in resource-constrained settings with limited memory, processing power, and battery life, making them highly vulnerable to data breaches or confidentiality issues that can disrupt farming operations and deter the adoption of IoT technologies \cite{ref8}. Traditional cryptographic algorithms, such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), impose excessive resource demands that are incompatible with the constraints of IoT devices \cite{ref2,ref8}. Consequently, researchers have increasingly turned to lightweight cryptographic alternatives that balance security with resource efficiency.

This study addresses these challenges by presenting a lightweight, secure data transmission framework tailored for IoT-based smart irrigation systems. The proposed framework leverages the modification of the RC4 encryption algorithm for its simplicity and computational efficiency in resource-constrained environments, despite known vulnerabilities. The system employs the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, a lightweight IoT messaging protocol, for secure and low-latency communication. Data collected from the NodeMCU sensor nodes is encrypted using modified RC4, transmitted via MQTT to a Raspberry Pi broker, and then securely stored in Google Cloud Firestore. Real-time visualization of decrypted data is provided using Looker Studio, enabling stakeholders to monitor irrigation parameters effectively.

\section{Related Work}
Research in lightweight cryptographic solutions for IoT environments has been extensive, driven by the need for secure communication within resource-constrained devices. For example, Fathy and Ali~\cite{ref1} proposed a secure IoT-based irrigation system that utilized the Expeditious Cipher to address the demands of low-power and high-efficiency encryption. Similarly,
Dehghantanha et al.~\cite{ref2} explored challenges and practical solutions for maintaining security and privacy in IoT networks, emphasizing the importance of lightweight algorithms.

Mukhopadhyay et al.~\cite{ref8} demonstrated the applicability of lightweight cryptography in wearable IoT devices. Their findings are particularly relevant to precision agriculture scenarios where real-time data from environmental sensors requires both confidentiality and minimal computational overhead. These studies underline the necessity of designing cryptographic methods that balance performance and security, serving as a foundation for the approach adopted in this paper.

Other works have compared various lightweight cryptographic schemes, including modified stream ciphers and hybrid encryption methods, to highlight trade-offs in terms of speed, memory consumption, and robustness~\cite{ref3,ref4}. These benchmarks provide valuable insights into how enhanced RC4 implementations, such as the one proposed in this study, can offer a practical balance between security and efficiency in IoT-based applications. By building on these previous efforts, this paper aims to further refine and validate a lightweight encryption framework tailored for real-time IoT environments.

The encryption framework employs the lightweight modified RC4 algorithm, selected for its computational efficiency in resource-constrained IoT devices \cite{ref10}. The data flow is structured to ensure secure and reliable transmission of environmental data from the sensor nodes to the visualization platform. The process is described below.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Data Collection and Encryption at Sensor Nodes:}

        \item Encrypted data is published to the MQTT broker on the Raspberry Pi under designated topics using a secure Wi-Fi connection \cite{ref21}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Handling at MQTT Broker (Raspberry Pi):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The broker receives encrypted messages from sensor nodes.
        \item It decrypts the messages using RC4 to verify data integrity \cite{ref16}.
        \item After verification, the broker re-encrypts the data using a unique session key to enhance security before forwarding it to the cloud.
        \item The re-encrypted data is transmitted securely to Google Cloud Firestore via HTTPS \cite{ref22}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Storage in Google Cloud Firestore:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The encrypted data is stored in Firestore as documents organized by sensor nodes or data types \cite{ref19}.
        \item Firestore ensures real-time synchronization and scalability for efficient handling of large datasets \cite{ref20}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Decryption using Google Cloud Function:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A serverless Google Cloud Function is triggered during data retrieval.
        \item The cloud function decrypts the data using RC4 and securely forwards the plaintext data to the visualization platform \cite{ref22}.
    \end{itemize}

        \item Looker Studio retrieves decrypted data from the cloud function.
        \item Interactive dashboards and visualizations display real-time sensor readings, historical trends, and actionable insights for stakeholders \cite{ref20}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Modified RC4 Encryption Process}

\textbf{Problem in the original RC4: The key scheduling algorithm (KSA) in original RC4 is weak, leading to vulnerabilities such as predictable initial bytes in the keystream.}  
The enhancement in RC4 used in this framework is by introducing additional key mixing in the KSA phase through:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The use of a hash function (e.g., SHA-256) to preprocess the key.
    \item Increasing the size of the permutation array by randomizing it with pseudorandom number generation (PRNG)~\cite{ref2,ref9}.
\end{enumerate}
These stages work together to produce a keystream that encrypts each byte of the data, making enhanced RC4 suitable for lightweight, real-time IoT applications.

\textbf{1) Key Scheduling Algorithm (KSA):} The KSA initializes a state array \( S \) of 256 bytes, with each position in \( S \) containing a unique byte value from 0 to 255. Using the encryption key \( K \), \( S \) is permuted as follows:
\[
j = (j + S[i] + K[i \bmod \text{key\_length}]) \mod 256
\]
\begin{equation}
S[i], S[j] = S[j], S[i],
\end{equation}
where \( i \) ranges from 0 to 255, and \( j \) is initialized to 0.

\textbf{2) Pseudo-Random Generation Algorithm (PRGA):} After the KSA, the PRGA continuously modifies \( S \) to generate the keystream. The variables \( i \) and \( j \) are initialized to zero before starting the PRGA loop. For each byte of data:
\begin{equation}
i = (i + 1) \mod 256,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
j = (j + S[i]) \mod 256,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
S[i], S[j] = S[j], S[i],
\end{equation}
The generated keystream byte \( K_t \) is:
\begin{equation}
t = (S[i] + S[j]) \mod 256,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
K_t = S[t].
\end{equation}

\textbf{3) Encryption:} Each byte of plaintext data \( P \) is XORed with the keystream byte \( K_t \) to produce the encrypted byte \( C \):
\begin{equation}
C = P \oplus K_t.
\end{equation}

This lightweight modified encryption mechanism makes RC4 ideal for IoT devices, allowing each sensor node to perform encryption with minimal resource consumption, supporting real-time data security. Encryption keys are pre-shared between the sensor nodes and the MQTT broker during the device provisioning stage. To enhance security, keys are stored securely on the devices, and periodic key rotation is implemented.

These enhancements maintain RC4's lightweight properties while addressing vulnerabilities, making it suitable for real-time IoT applications such as precision agriculture irrigation systems.

Humidity readings indicate a consistent relationship with irrigation and weather events. Spikes in the graph correspond to irrigation cycles, while gradual increases reflect naturally humid periods. These trends provide insight into when water usage is most efficient.

\textbf{Soil Moisture Monitoring:}  
Soil moisture levels show a steady decline between irrigation events, followed by sharp increases when watering occurs. This pattern highlights the systemâ€™s ability to maintain optimal moisture levels and helps identify when adjustments to irrigation schedules might be needed.

\textbf{Combined View:}  
When these data sets are viewed together, a story begins to emerge. Rising temperatures often lead to increased evaporation, which is mirrored by a drop in soil moisture levels. The visualization helps identify how different factors influence each other, enabling more informed decision-making for crop management.
